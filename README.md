Kuesuto is a passion project and homage to *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past*, combining classic action RPG elements with handcrafted pixel art and a meticulously designed world. Developed entirely in TypeScript, this project showcases custom game mechanics, intricate AI, and an immersive storyline set in a beautifully pixelated world.

### Game Overview

Kuesuto transports players to the enchanted Forest of Verdelight, where the balance of nature is threatened by an ancient dark magic. The player assumes the role of a silver-haired protagonist who must face the Shadowthorn’s corruption and a host of adversaries to protect the forest. Along the way, the player encounters mysterious allies, like **Morghul**, a dark wizard who hints at a larger, unfolding destiny.

### Technical Highlights

Kuesuto's development involved creating an entirely custom game engine in TypeScript, including a unique pathfinding library called **[Pather](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcia125/pather)**, which has been open-sourced for other developers. This pathfinding system enables enemies to track and pursue the player with precision, adding a challenging dynamic to combat encounters. The map design was created in *Tiled*, a popular tool for building pixel art maps, allowing for a rich and cohesive game environment.

**Key Features:**

* **Handcrafted Pixel Art**: Custom, retro-inspired visuals that add to the game's nostalgic feel.
* **Responsive Controls**: Movement uses **WASD** or arrow keys, with a custom on-screen controller for mobile.
* **Real-Time Action Combat**: Engage enemies in close combat, leveling up as you gain experience.
* **Advanced Enemy AI**: Enemies use the Pather library to track the player’s movements, increasing difficulty and realism.
* **Dynamic Storyline**: Interact with NPCs like Morghul, who offer guidance and reveal the lore of Verdelight.

### Meet Morghul, the Dark Wizard

Morghul, a robed figure shrouded in mystery, serves as a powerful ally and guide to the player. As the story begins, Morghul addresses the player with an eerie insight into their role in the forest's fate:

> **Morghul**: "Ah, so you are the one foretold by the ancient prophecies. How curious that a mere elf stands at the crossroads of destiny."

> Morghul steps forward, his eyes glowing with enigmatic power. "I am Morghul, a seeker of ancient truths. The Forest of Verdelight faces a dire threat. The Shadowthorn spreads with purpose. Your presence here is no coincidence."

With each interaction, Morghul reveals more about the dark magic corrupting the forest, setting the player on a journey to find and eliminate its source.
